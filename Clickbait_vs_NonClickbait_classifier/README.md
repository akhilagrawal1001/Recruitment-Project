The python file asks if user wants to enter the location of click.txt and non_click.txt, which contain the data by which the model will be trained.

By default the program is written by assuming that user will run program on google colab. User has to upload these data files(click.txt and non_click.txt in repository) in the 'Files' section in colab file,
which are uploaded in '/content' directory by default.

The data files are present in the repository and have been picked from public dataset available at "https://github.com/bhargaviparanjape/clickbait"
