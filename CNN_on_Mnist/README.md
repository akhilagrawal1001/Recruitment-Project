This model loads 'Fashion MNIST' data that comes within tensorflow.keras.datasets

The program splits data in test data and train data, trains the model on train data, and prints the model evalutaion on the test data in the end.

While training, Convulation and Pooling layers have also been used to improve the effeciency of the model.
